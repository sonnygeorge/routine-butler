# RoutineButler

## 👾 What is the App?

`RoutineButler` is an app that:

- 🥧 is designed to be run "kiosk-style" on a RaspberryPi connected to:

  - 📺 an LCD touchscreen interface

  - 📦 an electro-mechanically operated lockbox

- 🏋️‍♀️ administers user-set routines with incentives (such as unlocking the box)

## 👾 Who would use it?

First and foremost, the app is for my own use (I have already built raspberry-pi+lockbox+touchscreen kiosk setup).

Nevertheless, I am trying to take into consideration the possibility that other people might want to use this app someday as well.

## 👾 What does it do?

The app allows users to:

- 📝 configure routines
- 📝 configure programs
- 💪 have routines administered to them
- 🔒 lock their phone away as an incentive to complete routines

## 👾 TODO

- [ ] NICEGUI QUESTION - single-use timer w/ progress bar?
- [ ] Evaluate strategy for alarm in ui/db anf hook up the two
- [ ] Get crud mixin roasted?
- [ ] Evaluate typed dict for dataclasses... [pydantic alternative](https://roman.pt/posts/pydantic-in-sqlalchemy-fields/)
- [ ] Implement [trailing](https://nicegui.io/documentation/slider#throttle_events_with_leading_and_trailing_options) throttling where appropriate

- **NOTE:** "PromptWaitContinue", "RepeatMantra", and "MemesQueue" are just placeholder `ProgramPlugins` to help illustrate the idea... I might or might not implement them as suggested in the diagram... However, everything else is how I actually envision it as of now.
