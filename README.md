# RoutineButler

**RoutineButler** is an app that is designed to be run "kiosk-style" on a RaspberryPi 🥧 connected to:

- 📺 an LCD touchscreen interface
- 📦 an electro-mechanically operated lockbox

Its purpose is to alart and administer "routines" 🏋️‍♂️  to users in exchange for incentives (such as unlocking whatever they may have put in the lockbox).

Here is a picture of my current setup which I am actively using as my morning and evening alarm clock:
